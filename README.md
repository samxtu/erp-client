## An E-Commerce ERP client

### The Talisia project is an E-Commerce application for buying and selling products online.

#### The project is a Business to Business (B2B) and Business to Consumer (B2C) where businesses will serve to other businesses or cunsumers through Halisia as go-between where the products will pass through for cross-checking if they meet the requirements and delivered to the buyer.

#### There is potential for online marketing in Tanzania which can be exploited if the businesses can gain the trust of the consumers in delivering products as per requirements and on time. Currently many Tanzanians simply do not trust the online market and thus with a good system, we are going to change that.

#### This specific repositories includes pages to register sales, purchases, expenses and monitor employees performance and business performance with sofisticated reports.
